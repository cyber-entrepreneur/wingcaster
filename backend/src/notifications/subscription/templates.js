/**
 * Notification content templates.

 * Each event kind has: subject, plaintext body, and optional html
 * body. Templates receive a `ctx` object with variables the caller
 * populates. Missing variables render as blank — templates are
 * defensive and don't throw on missing keys.
 *
 * Keep these editable-by-non-devs by keeping them declarative
 * (no logic beyond simple {{var}} substitution). Rich variants
 * (localized, per-territory) can layer on later without touching
 * the dispatcher.
