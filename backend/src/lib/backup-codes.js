/**
 * Single-use backup codes — the recovery path when the authenticator device
 * is lost.
 *
 * Because Phase 7f deliberately removes email as a sign-in fallback once TOTP
 * is enrolled (an attacker holding the password plus the mailbox would
 * otherwise defeat the second factor entirely), these codes are the ONLY way
 * back into an account whose phone is gone. They are correspondingly
 * security-critical:
 *
 *   * ~50 bits of entropy each, from a crypto RNG.
 *   * Only bcrypt hashes are persisted; plaintext is returned exactly once at
 *     enrolment (and once more on regenerate, which invalidates the previous
 *     set) and is unrecoverable afterwards.
 *   * Redemption is single-use — the row is stamped `used_at` inside the same
 *     transaction that consumes the challenge.
 *
 * There is intentionally no plaintext lookup key stored alongside the hash.
 * Indexing on a prefix of the code would make redemption a single bcrypt
 * compare instead of a scan, but it would also leak that prefix at rest, and
 * a partial code is a meaningful head start for anyone holding a database
 * dump. The scan is bounded at ten compares and sits behind a challenge that
 * already required the correct password, so the cost is not attacker-
 * controllable in any useful way.
